# Colorado Fire Watch

**Elevator Pitch**  
Wildfire risk is one of the most urgent challenges facing the American West. **Colorado Fire Watch** predicts wildfire risk across Colorado using a novel combination of **NEONâ€™s high-resolution Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) data** and **broad-coverage satellite sensors like Sentinel-2 and MODIS**.  

Most models stop at weather and vegetation indices. This project goes further by tying fine-scale ecological data to scalable satellite products, creating predictions that are both **scientifically rigorous** and **operationally useful**.

## Why This Project Matters

Wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity, threatening lives, communities, and ecosystems. Existing risk models provide useful forecasts but often miss the ecological nuance of vegetation condition, fuel load, and microclimate.  

Colorado Fire Watch is different because it:  

- **Bridges depth and scale**: NEON AOP delivers detail no satellite can match; Sentinel-2 and MODIS extend those insights statewide.  
- **Connects to real fire history**: Several NEON field sites overlap with burned areas, allowing direct validation of model performance.  
- **Advances remote sensing science**: Building crosswalks between hyperspectral/LiDAR data and multispectral sensors is a new approach with applications far beyond wildfire risk.  
- **Scales beyond Colorado**: Once proven, the same framework can extend to other western states for regional fire monitoring.

## Project Vision

- **Use fine-scale ecological data** from NEON AOP (hyperspectral + LiDAR) at Colorado field sites.  
- **Translate those insights** to Sentinel-2 and MODIS for landscape-scale coverage.  
- **Test wildfire risk predictions** at sites with known burn histories.  
- **Develop models** (statistical, machine learning, hybrid) to compare performance and refine methods.

## Key Features (Planned)

- An interactive interface showing daily wildfire risk across Colorado  
- Crosswalk models linking NEON AOP to Sentinel-2 and MODIS products  
- Validation datasets tied to past fire events at NEON field sites  
- A framework for testing and comparing multiple models, with room for ensemble methods down the line

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (MVP):**  
  - Deploy a basic interface showing fire risk estimates for Colorado  
  - Build first crosswalk between NEON AOP and Sentinel-2  

- **Phase 2 (Expansion):**  
  - Add MODIS integration and extend to additional western states  
  - Incorporate historical fire records for validation  

- **Phase 3 (Advanced Modeling):**  
  - Compare and combine different models into a more robust product  
  - Deliver scalable pipelines for operational use

## Future Scope

Potential extensions include:  

- Incorporating near-real-time meteorological data  
- Adding layers for fuel moisture, topography, and human infrastructure  
- Expanding validation datasets beyond NEON  
- Quantifying uncertainty through ensemble modeling
